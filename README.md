For question di) I created a new menu on in the header and also used jQuery to pull the lab data from the json file and create a drop down for it.

dii) Upon loading the page, it will create a dialog window that has the instructions for the lab in it. The window is resizable and moveable as the instructions expect.

diii) For my projects page I created an accordion for each of the labs and wrote a little summary for each one.

div) I added a simple button and draggable block on my home page just for fun and to play around with the widgets.
